# Planning Corpus

GitHub milestones and issues are the source of truth for planning state.

Local planning files are intentionally minimal:

- `active/`: lightweight notes for currently active work only.
- `generated/`: generated exports/reports.
- `remaining_task_review_catalog.json`: minimal local catalog stub used by tooling.

Legacy planning corpus files were removed from this repository.
