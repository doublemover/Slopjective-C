## Done-Criteria Reconciliation

- Regroup packet links all dependency issue closure evidence: `MET`.
- No dependency blockers remain open for M132 (`#4228` through `#4237`): `MET`.
- Regroup gate issue [#4238](https://github.com/doublemover/Slopjective-C/issues/4238): `OPEN` (closeout packet now published).

## INT-RG Closeout Recommendation

`M132-INT-RG-01` is ready to close once this packet update is posted to [#4238](https://github.com/doublemover/Slopjective-C/issues/4238).
