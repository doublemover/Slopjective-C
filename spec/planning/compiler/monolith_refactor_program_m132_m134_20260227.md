# Monolith Refactor Program (M132-M134)

This source-of-truth marker was restored to preserve issue packet references after planning corpus reduction.

## Scope

- M132: architecture contract freeze and dependency boundary enforcement.
- M133: subsystem extraction and libraryization.
- M134: generated output cutover, thin CLI driver extraction, and final API stabilization.

## Canonical Execution Source

- GitHub milestones/issues are the live execution source.
- Closeout packets:
  - `spec/planning/compiler/m133/m133_closeout_evidence_20260227.md`
  - `spec/planning/compiler/m134/m134_closeout_evidence_20260227.md`
